# Cardiovascular System Features

## Main Components
 - Pumps blood
 - Transport Blood via Blood vessels
 - Blood itself

## Conceptual Model

### Systemic Circulation

- Heart > Arteries > Capillaries > Veins > Heart

### Pulmonary Circulation

- Heart > Lungs > Heart

## Important Formulas

- Blood Flow
  - Flow = Pressure Difference / Resistance
  - Q = [delta]P / (R)Resistance
  - Systole increases pressure; diastole decreases it
  - Resistance = vessel diameter and length. (Will be a constant for now)
