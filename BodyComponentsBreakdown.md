# Human Body As Systems and Components

## Skeletal System

### Components

- Bones
  - 206 Bones total
- Joints
  - Allows for flexibility
- Cartiliage
  - Tough but flexible
  - Found at the end of bones and in joints

### Functions

- Support
  - Gives body shape and provides structural support
- Protection
  - Surrounds and protects vital organs.
- Movement
  - Provides attachment points for muscles
  - Joints allows for various movements
- Mineral Storage
  - Stores essential minerals (Calcium and Phosphorus)
  - Minerals can be release into blood stream
- Stores Fat
  - Yellow bone marrow stores fat
- Endocrine Regulation
  - Can release hormones like osteocalcin, which helps regulate blood sugar and fat deposition
- Balance and Posture
  - Contributes body stability, balance, and proper posture
- Sensory Function
  - Contains sensory receptors for pain and pressure

## Muscular System

### Components

- Muscles
  - Bundles of tissue which can contract to produce movement
  - Three types:
    - Skeletal
    - Smooth
    - Cardiac
- Tendons
  - Connective tissues that connects muscles to bones
  - Assist in transmitting the force generated by muscle contractions to generate movement
- Fascia
  - Connective tissue that surrounds and separates muscles which provides support and protection

### Functions

- Movement
  - This is done contracting and relaxing muscles.
  - Skeletal muscles are in charge of voluntary movememnt. i.e. walking, running, lifting objects.
- Posture and Stability
  - Muscles maintain posture and stabilize joints which support the body against gravity.
- Heat Generation
  - Muscles activity generates heat which help maintain body temperature
  - Shivering is a reflexive response that increases body temperature when the body is cold
- Protection
  - Provides padding for underlying structures
- Blood Circulation
  - Facilitates blood circulation via the skeletal muscles by acting as pumps
- Respiration
  - Muscles involved in breathing facilitate the inhalation and exhalation of air.
- Digestion
  - Smooth muscles in the digestive tract help move food through the digestive system
- Facial Expression
  - Muscles of the face and the neck allow for a wide variety of facial expressions which are used during communication and social interactions

## Cardiovascular System

### Components

- Heart
  - The muscular pump at the center of the system.
  - Divided into four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers).
  - Pumps blood throughout the body via rhythmic contractions.
- Blood Vessels
  - A network of tubular structures that transport blood.
-Arteries
  - Carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body.
- Veins
  - Return oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart.
- Capillaries
  - Tiny vessels where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste occurs between blood and tissues.
- Blood
  - The fluid that circulates through the vessels, consisting of:
    - Red Blood Cells (RBCs): Carry oxygen using hemoglobin.
    - White Blood Cells (WBCs): Defend the body against infections.
- Platelets: Aid in blood clotting.
- Plasma: The liquid component that transports nutrients, hormones, and waste products.

### Functions

- Transportation
  - Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide
    - Transports oxygen from the lungs to tissues and removes carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs.
  - Nutrients and Hormones
    - Delivers nutrients from the digestive system and hormones from glands to cells.
  - Waste Removal
    - Carries waste products like carbon dioxide and urea to organs like the lungs and kidneys for excretion.
- Regulation
  - Helps regulate body temperature by distributing heat.
  - Maintains homeostasis by balancing pH, fluid levels, and electrolyte concentrations.
- Protection:
  - Immune Function
    - WBCs in the blood defend against pathogens.
  Clotting Mechanism
    - Platelets and clotting factors prevent excessive blood loss during injuries.
- Blood Pressure Maintenance
  - Arteries and the heart work together to maintain consistent blood pressure, ensuring effective circulation to all tissues.
- Support for Other Systems
  - Works closely with the respiratory system for oxygen exchange.
  - Supports the kidneys in filtering and maintaining fluid balance.
