# Human Body As Systems and Components

## Skeletal System

### Components

- Bones
  - 206 Bones total
- Joints
  - Allows for flexibility
- Cartiliage
  - Tough but flexible
  - Found at the end of bones and in joints

### Functions

- Support
  - Gives body shape and provides structural support
- Protection
  - Surrounds and protects vital organs.
- Movement
  - Provides attachment points for muscles
  - Joints allows for various movements
- Mineral Storage
  - Stores essential minerals (Calcium and Phosphorus)
  - Minerals can be release into blood stream
- Stores Fat
  - Yellow bone marrow stores fat
- Endocrine Regulation
  - Can release hormones like osteocalcin, which helps regulate blood sugar and fat deposition
- Balance and Posture
  - Contributes body stability, balance, and proper posture
- Sensory Function
  - Contains sensory receptors for pain and pressure

## Muscular System

### Components

- Muscles
  - Bundles of tissue which can contract to produce movement
  - Three types:
    - Skeletal
    - Smooth
    - Cardiac
- Tendons
  - Connective tissues that connects muscles to bones
  - Assist in transmitting the force generated by muscle contractions to generate movement
- Fascia
  - Connective tissue that surrounds and separates muscles which provides support and protection

### Functions

- Movement
  - This is done contracting and relaxing muscles.
  - Skeletal muscles are in charge of voluntary movememnt. i.e. walking, running, lifting objects.
- Posture and Stability
  - Muscles maintain posture and stabilize joints which support the body against gravity.
- Heat Generation
  - Muscles activity generates heat which help maintain body temperature
  - Shivering is a reflexive response that increases body temperature when the body is cold
- Protection
  - Provides padding for underlying structures
- Blood Circulation
  - Facilitates blood circulation via the skeletal muscles by acting as pumps
- Respiration
  - Muscles involved in breathing facilitate the inhalation and exhalation of air.
- Digestion
  - Smooth muscles in the digestive tract help move food through the digestive system
- Facial Expression
  - Muscles of the face and the neck allow for a wide variety of facial expressions which are used during communication and social interactions
